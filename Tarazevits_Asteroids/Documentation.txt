Asteroids

List of User Functionality
-w to accelerate
-s to decelerate
-a and d to rotate
-spacebar to fire bullets
-Enter to start the game
-e to see controls
-In game controls menu

Reasoning behind design choices
The game features minimalistic graphics to represent older arcade games
The asteroids are randomly colored to provide a more retro look. I also
didn't like the pure white on black look.



Brief description of above and beyond features
The game features drift just like classic asteroids. It also has a Finite State Machine
powering the game menu system. I also used an array to track key input to allow
multiple keys to be pressed simultaneously. I wrote a Quadtree class to optimize
collision detection but Processing deleted it and I didn't want to redo 2 hours 
of work. 

Requirements not completed
Ship does not decelerate without user input. This allows for drifting motion.
User can decelerate the ship by pressing 's'. Assignment was turned in 1 day late
but I am using a grace day.
